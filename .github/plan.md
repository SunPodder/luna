We are building a high performance modern code editor using C++, Qt6/QML, OpenGL and other cutting-edge technologies. Our goal is to create an editor that is fast, efficient, and user-friendly, catering to the needs of developers who require a powerful tool for coding.

The IDE will be designed around AI native development, integrating advanced AI features to assist developers in writing, debugging, and optimizing their code. We aim to leverage AI to enhance productivity and streamline the development process.
